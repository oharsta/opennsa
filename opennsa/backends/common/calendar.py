"""
Backend reservation calendar.

Keeps track of reservation timeslots for resources.

Inteded usage is for NRM backend which does not have their own reservation calendar.

The module assumes that any expired reservations are removed. Otherwise the
overlap detection will not work properly.

None is allowed for start and end time. In that case the semantics is now for
start time and forever for end time.
